# Automatic Runbook Toolkit

Inspired by this project: https://github.com/ljcucc/terminal_configs , which can automatic finish my config. but the tools have a little bit to hard to use and buggy, so I decide to build a new one with more customization.

## How to custom automation?

You can custom and config your automation by config your main.py

## What's different bewteen Ansible?

Ansible will be more complex and fat when to use some simple config and setup flow develop, which have a lot of basic to learn. but in the case, this tools is build for special purpose, unlike ansible for general purpose.
